Docker Registry Deployment on Kubernetes

This manifest file defines a set of Kubernetes resources for deploying a Docker registry with persistent storage provided by a GlusterFS-based storage class. The code also includes an Ingress for external access over HTTPS.
Prerequisites

Before deploying the resources, you should ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

  A Kubernetes cluster with GlusterFS installed
  kubectl CLI tool installed
  helm CLI tool installed
  A domain name or IP address to access the Docker registry UI

Usage
To deploy the resources pvc, run the folowing command:
 
    kubectl apply -f docker-registry-pvc.yaml

To deploy the resources deployment, run the following command:

    kubectl apply -f docker-registry-deployment.yaml
    
To deploy the resources ingress, run the following command:

    kubectl apply -f ingress.yaml
 
Replace docker-registry.yaml with the name of the manifest file.
Customization

The manifest file includes hard-coded configurations for each resource, which may not be suitable for all environments. To customize the deployment, you can modify the manifest file to change the configuration of each resource.
Best Practices

To ensure a secure and reliable deployment of the Docker registry, follow these best practices:

  Use SSL/TLS encryption to secure the Docker registry UI and API endpoints.
  Use a strong password for the admin user and avoid sharing credentials.
  Enable RBAC to control access to the Docker registry UI and API endpoints.
  Use a dedicated namespace for the Docker registry to avoid interference with other applications.
  Regularly back up the Docker registry configuration and backup storage.

Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during the installation or operation of the Docker registry, refer to the Docker registry documentation ↗ or the Kubernetes documentation ↗ for troubleshooting steps.
